# NoGame

Proxy server which limits the amount of time on a list of hosts.

This was created to block a nephew from spending too much time playing online games.


## TODO

* update the proxy server (if the user adds or removes a hostname)
* have a configurable path to the hosts file
* url to kill and restart the server
